<!-- Extending the predefined project layout -->
{% extends "layouts/base.html" %}

<!- This variable sets name of browser tab  -->
{% set project = "Group Project" %}

<!- This is a replacement block for Body in base.html -->
{% block body %}
    <!- Try building a new body here, bootstrap is a wise choice ->
    <div class="px-5 py-5 mx-auto">
        <h1 class="text-primary"><strong>Group Project</strong></h1>
        <p class="text-secondary">Our project is making a planner where people can write about they're planning to do as well as record their daily moments and messages.</p>
    </div>
{% endblock %}
